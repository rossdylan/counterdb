CounterDB - Web Scale Counting
----------------------------------------------


CounterDB is a prototype database for UVB. Built as an exploration into methods
of storing counters in a distributed fashion. Current mainline UVB stores
counters in lmdb, or a in memory hashmap. CounterDB stores counters in-memory
using dictionaries, and synchronizes between nodes using a G-Counter CRDT. The
goal being that any node can service a request without having a immediately
propagate changes to all other nodes.
